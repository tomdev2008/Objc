Icons

================================================================================
ABSTRACT:

This sample demonstrates the proper use of application icons on iOS.

Every app is required to have an app icon. In addition, it is recommended that apps also provide icons for additional areas outside of the app including: Homescreen, Spotlight, the Settings app, and when creating an Ad Hoc build and adding it to iTunes.

This sample is a universal binary that supports iPhone/iPod touch/iPad and includes 
support for high resolution displays.
